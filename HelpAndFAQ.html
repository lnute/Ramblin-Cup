            <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
            <p>The Ramblin’ Cup is an annual competition between numerous teams at Georgia Tech
                (similar to the Hogwarts House Cup) meant to unite students under a single purpose.
                Various events and challenges are held throughout the year in order for each team to
                gain points. The team with the greatest amount of points at the end of the year is declared
                the winner. </p>

            <p><strong>Who participates?</strong></p>
            <p>Everyone! Each student upon admittance to Georgia Tech is sorted into one of many
                teams: White, Gold, Navy, Yellow Jakcets, Ramblin' Wrecks, etc. At the beginning of each semester, each student signs up for which events they would like to be a part of to gain points for their team.</p>

            <p><strong>What are the challenges?</strong></p>
            <p>Events and challenges held throughout the year to gain points for your team are as
                diverse as the interests of the student body itself. Some events are traditional and are
                always held annually, such as Humans versus Zombies, and Tug o’ War. However, student
                organizations can submit their own events as well, giving students who aren’t already a
                part of that organization a chance to “try out” a particular club to see if they are interested.
                VGDev, Georgia Tech’s game development organization, for example, might hold a game
                jam event with the best game winning points for a particular team. Challenges and events
                are diverse in time commitment as well; some may be ongoing for a week and some may be
                just for one evening.</p>

            <p><strong>When is it?</strong></p>
            <p>The Ramblin' Cup starts at midnight on the first instructional day of the Fall semester and continues until the last instructional day of the Spring Semester. There will be no events during the summer, but events may occur over breaks, such as Thanksgiving, Winter, or Spring break.</p>
