                    <p>Humans vs. Zombies is a large game similar to tag, played by hundreds of people on campus every semester. Each player signs up and receives a yellow bandanna, which they wear on the upper arm to denote themselves as human. Zombies, who wear their bandanna on the head, tag humans to increase the zombie population.<br>

                    <legend><strong>Mini 500</strong></legend>
                    <p>The Mini 500 is an annual tricycle race around Peters Parking Deck that occurs on the Friday afternoon before the homecoming football game. It is one of Georgia Tech’s most unique traditions put on by Ramblin’ Reck Club since 1969. Teams are comprised of seven members: 4 to take turns as the driver and three on the pit crew. Each team is required to rotate the front tire of their tricycle three times throughout the course of the race. All teams try to complete 8 laps without destroying their tricycle. Some teams utilize their engineering skill set, as necessary (but restricted) reinforcement of the tricycle is imperative to a team’s success. The Mini 500 is without a doubt one of the most entertaining events of Homecoming week and is definitely something you won’t want to miss!</p>
